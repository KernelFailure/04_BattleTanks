# 04_BattleTanks
Head to head tank battles in an open terrain

## Concept

### Limited Amount of Ammo
1. Can we do reloads?
2. Can we pick up more ammo during play?
3. Can we choose different weapons?


### Hit Results
1. It doesn't matter where a shot lands
2. As long as it touches, it will always take the same damage/have the same effect

### Healthbar
1. Every hit reduces by a constant bit
2. Can we pick up more health during play?
3. Can we see our health stats?
4. Can we see our enemies health stats?

### Time
1. Is there a time-limit
2. Is time in any other way a factor in this game?

### Driving Speed
1. How is speed controlled in the game?
2. What about an in-game, temporary upgrade for greater speed?

### Far Out Thoughts
  *Should there be things like missle alert/ lock on alert
  *Objective based gameplay?
